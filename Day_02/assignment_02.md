# Notes
- React does not make our application fast, there are many packages to use which makes React app fast, scalable and production ready.
- npm is not node package manager. It manages packages.
- package.json is configuration for nmp.
- npm init will initalize the the configuration and creates package.json file.
- One of the important package in project is Bundler.
- As we have HTML, CSS, JS these files have to be bundled, minified, compressed, cached, cleaned before moving to production. Eg. Webpack, Parcel, Vite.
- Create React App uses React Webpack and Babel behind the scenes.
- npm install -D parcel, D stands for dev dependency.
- Two types of Dependency - Dev dependency and Normal dependency.
- Dev dependency is required during development of the app.
- Normal dependency is used in production also.
- ^2.11.0 - ^ updates only minor upgrades in the version automatically. (Safe Choice)
- ~2.11.0 - ~ updates major upgrades automatically.
- package-lock.json: Keeps tack of exact version of the package
- package-lock.json has key called integrity which has value of hash code. This hashcode is used to maintain same version of package that is being used in both local and production.
